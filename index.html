                    <p class="mb-5">Greetings Operator,</p>
                    <p class="mb-5">You have been selected from thousands of applicants to take part in the training offered by JS/Onboarding. </p>
                    <p class="mb-5">Ever since the downfall of the Terra Republic in 2078, the knowledge of using JavaScript has only been wielded by those that have been deemed worthy. By entrusting this knowledge to you, the corporation will utilize your skills as a weapon, pointing you towards our enemies to safeguard our political and financial interests.</p>
                    <p class="mb-5">The sections that can be accessed on the left side of the console, will take you to our learning area. You may have come across some of these concepts at some point in your life, but utilizing them in a way to make a difference is a different beast altogether. If you encounter any bugs or timeslips through your learnings, please report all issues to your commanding officer immediately.</p>
                    <p class="mb-5">If you abide by all of the rules of wielding JavaScript, we are more than happy to welcome you into our fold. If you abuse your power, or decide to use it against the corporation, you will be dealt with swiftly. Hopefully, it never has to come to that.</p>
