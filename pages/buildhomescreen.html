                        <p>In this project we will be focusing on building the smart phone home screen by using a few JavaScript functions that are very widely used in DOM manipulation.</p>

                        <p>The first will be creating an Array of objects, the next will be creating an element and lastly we will go over appending that element to the DOM.</p>

                        <p>If this is your first time looking at this it can be a little confusing, but with time it will become much easier. Knowing what you can do with JavaScript is half the battle, im</p>

                        <p>Let's go!</p>
                    </div>
                              
                    <div class="project-html" id="project-html">
                        <div class="ide-mockup">
                            <img src="/img/homescreen/home-screen-css-font-awesome.png">
                        </div>
                        <p>The very first thing you will need to do for this project is to link the "Font Awesome" stylesheet to your HTML. You can either go through <a href="https://fontawesome.com/"><span class="ide-green">Font Awesome</span></a> or you can head to <a href="https://cdnjs.com/libraries/font-awesome"><span class="ide-green">CDNJS</span></a> and copy the LINK tag on the first selection.</p>

                        <div class="ide-mockup">
                            <img src="/img/homescreen/home-screen-html-001.png">
                        </div>
                        <p>The first element that we will be adding is the div with the id/class <span class="ide-purple">"home-screen-app-container"</span>. It will be placed inside the <span class="ide-purple">"smart-phone-container"</span> but will not serve as a container for the <span class="ide-purple">"smart-phone-home-button</span>."</p>

                        <p>After this we want to create an unordered list element [ul] and give it the id/class of <span class="ide-purple">"home-screen-app-list</span>, and place it inside the <span class="ide-purple">"home-screen-app-container" div</span>." Generally we would want to put our list items [li] in here but we will be generating those through the JavaScript and appending them to this UL parent element.</p>
                    </div>
                
                    <div class="project-css" id="project-css">


                        <div class="ide-mockup">
                            <img src="/img/homescreen/smart-phone-container-001.png">
                        </div>
                            
                        <p><span class="ide-yellow"></span> This is is the main container for the project that makes it look like a smart phone. It will hold the other divs and components you will be using for the project.</p>

                        <p>The very first thing you should set is the position of the div. The position of relative is like telling the browser that other things are going to be put in here, and it will be used as the footprint of where those things can be situated.</p>

                        <p> Set the overflow to hidden so anything that finds it's way outside of the div will not show up in the browser</p>

                        <p>The next 3 things were for the margin in my project. They basically just give you some space and center the container in the div above this current one.</p>

                        <p>The background settings are all pretty standard. The background is linked to a URL that will use a photo as a background instead of a color. If you would like to download the exact picture I used, you can grab it <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/psdV2Rl-GvU" target="blank"><span class="ide-green">here</span></a> on Unsplash. You can also use any picture you would like but I suggest using one that has a portrait orientation</p>

                        <p>The other background settings are used for positioning the background in the div. The most significant one is having a background size of "contain." Generally you would like to use "cover" but we would like the full picture showing to get the effect of the smartphone in this project.</p>

                        <p>I have set the height and width here. I tend to use REM because I have been told that it is better for accessibility over pixels. I do believe it is also more responsive.</p>

                        <p>The rest of the settings are for detailing. If you're not aware yet, border-radius is what gives you those nice little rounded edges you see on every button on every single website.</p>

                        <div class="ide-mockup">
                            <img src="/img/homescreen/smart-phone-home-button-001.png">
                        </div>

                        <p><span class="ide-yellow"></span> The ".smart-phone-home-button" is the round button that exists... well used to exist on every single smartphone. In this project, pushing it will pull out the time bar. Generally it would bring up the home screen but hey, I needed something to work with.</p>

                        <p>The first thing you need to do is set the position to "absolute". Think of a position of absolute as unlocking the element to move around wherever you want on the page. By default it will set itself to the top left corner but with a few settings we can put it wherever we would like.</p>

                        <p>What I recommend doing first is setting the width and height of the button. This will allow us to calculate the absolute center of the div (if you would like to place the button in the center). You can pretty much put it anywhere you want by playing with the percentages in the next steps.</p>

                        <p>The left setting is how far we will place the element from the left side of the parent div (.digital-clock-container). The "calc" measurement is a little hack that allows you to find center since 50% will give center the left-most side of the button and not the center of the it. What this does is takes the 50% measurement and then you want to subtract half of the button element's width. Since you set it at 28px in the last step, you would cut that in half and minus 14px here.</p>

                        <p>The bottom measurement is how far off of the bottom of the parent div your button will sit.</p>

                        <p>The rest of the settings are used for styling. You may have noticed that I removed the outline (accessibility folks are fuming at me) but this is something we will look at in an upcoming step. I promise, this will be accessible!</p>

                        <p>Cursor pointer makes the little pointy hand appear when you hover over the element. Do not underestimate how much this is needed!</p>

                        <div class="ide-mockup">
                            <img src="/img/homescreen/smart-phone-home-button-002.png">
                        </div>

                        <p><span class="ide-purple">[.smart-phone-home-button:active] ||</span> This next little CSS trick I cannot take credit for. I 100% stole it from <a href="https://wesbos.com/"><span class="ide-green">Wes Bos</span></a> (who also has one of the best courses for learning JS called JavaScript30 available for free on his site!). What this trick does is scale the button that you click down just slightly to give it the appearance of being physically clicked.</p>

                        <p><span class="ide-purple">[.smart-phone-home-button:focus] ||</span> Alright! I told you I was going to make the button accessible. When you have an outline on a round button, it ends up being square and there is no way to adjust the border-radius. Using box-shadow will accomplish the same thing as outline but you can make it round. Add some styling and you got yourself a slick looking (and accessible) button!</p>

                        <div class="ide-mockup">
                            <img src="/img/digitalclock/builddigitalclockjavascript002.png">
                        </div>
                            <p>Note: I am going to start with the eventListeners for step 1 but after you complete this sub-section, scroll above it in your IDE and continue with creating the functions. I personally like starting with the eventListeners because you can then check if they are functioning with as you work.</p>

                            <p><span class="ide-yellow">1//</span> The first thing we want to assign is the home button on the phone to a variable. I used the variable homeButton.</p>
    
                            <p><span class="ide-yellow">2//</span> Now assign a click eventListener to the homeButton. This will be what calls out the clock div ('build-digital-clock') and runs the clock function (buildDigitalClock( )).</p>

                            <p><span class="ide-yellow">3//</span>This is not a typo. Skip this step for now.</p>
    
                            <p><span class="ide-yellow">4//</span> Assign the div with the id 'build-digital-clock' to the buildDigitalClock variable. This tells the browser to look for the ID on the page and recognize it as the buildDigitalClock variable.</p>
    
                            <p><span class="ide-yellow">5//</span> This IF statement is going to check if the div with the ID of 'build-digital-clock' has the class of "clicked." On the initial click it should not, which will lead to it running the ELSE statement to add it. If it does have it in subsequent clicks, the next line of code will run to remove it.</p>
    
                            <p><span class="ide-yellow">6//</span>The ELSE statement should be the first thing that runs when you initially click on the button. Basically this states if the div with the ID 'build-digital-clock' (which is assigned to variable buildDigitalClock) does not contain the class of 'clicked' it will add it.</p>
    
                            <p>At this point, clicking the button should call in the div holding the time placeholder. If you remember in the CSS we set it so it would slide in from the right, going from right of -80% to a right of 0%.</p>
    
                            <p><span class="ide-yellow">7//</span> This is where we are going to call the buildDigitalClock function, but there is one little thing we need to do here and that is to call it with an Interval. We want the function that builds the clock to update every single second so calling the function at an interval of 1000ms will cause it to refresh rather than just calling it once and sit static on whatever time it was when it was called.</p> 
                        
                        <div class="ide-mockup">    
                            <img src="/img/digitalclock/builddigitalclockjavascript001.png">
                        </div>

                            <p><span class="ide-yellow">8//</span> Now let's scroll above the eventListener section and code out the buildDigtalClock function. Create the function and let's pass in the code we want to run when it is called.</p>

                            <p><span class="ide-yellow">9//</span> Assign the div with the ID of 'build-digital-clock' to the variable of BuildDigitalClockDiv. This is actually the same element you grabbed in the eventListener section but is not accessible in this function. I decided to call it something different because we will be changing the innerHTML of it and it made more sense this way.</p>

                            <p><span class="ide-yellow">10//</span> JavaScript has a built-in function called Date that will create a new object with the current date and time. To access this function, let's declare a variable (I called it date) and use "new Date;" to access the information.</p>

                            <p><span class="ide-yellow">11//</span> With the date variable now declared we can extract some information out of it with some more built-in JavaScript functions. The next 3 lines of code will allow you to grab the current hour, minute, and seconds of the JavaScript Date function. There are more things (year, month, day, etc.) we can grab from this built-in function that I will cover in a future lesson. </p>

                            <p><span class="ide-yellow">12//</span> This IF/ELSE IF statement is what is going to convert the time to a 12 hour clock instead of a 24 hour clock. If you prefer to have a 24 hour clock you can skip. If not I can explain what we are doing here.</p>

                            <p>Basically the first part states that IF dataHours is more than 12, we are going to -12 from the hour variable. So 13 would be 1, 14 would be 2, etc.</p>

                            <p>The second part (ELSE IF) states that if the hour being given by the "new Date" funciton is 0 we would set the hour to 12. Which would be the hour between midnight and 1 AM. At this point it would show the time as 12:Minutes:Seconds instead of 00:Minutes:Seconds.</p>

                            <p><span class="ide-yellow">13//</span> This step is something you never really think about when assigning times. It's how awkward it can look when a 0 is not put in front of the current number if it's under 10. What these next steps will look for is if the variable is under 10 and if it is, will use concatenation to add a 0 before it.</p>

                            <p><span class="ide-yellow">14//</span> This is where we finally get to see what we have created displayed on the screen. What this will do is set the innerHTML of the buildDigitalClockDiv to dateHours, dateMinutes, and dateSeconds by using template literals. These are achieved by using backticks (`) and dollar sign/curly braces (${ }) around the variable (as seen above). At this step it is best to delete the placeholder time that you added when we created the HTML, so it does not remain visible when the function is first called.</p>     

                            <p><span class="ide-yellow">15//</span> Lastly, this was something I found made the clock run a little better. Let's scroll down to the eventListener section and call the function of buildDigitalClock() right after the click. What was happening is when I called the clock it would slide out and then the time would appear. By calling the function here, it seems to buffer it a little so the time is loaded by time it slides out. I'm not sure if this is intended but it seems to be working so I'm going to take credit for it.</p>
                            
                            <p>So there you have it! I hope you learned something from this project. You can use some of the CSS elements we went over in here to create a slide out menu and some of the clock components to create a countdown timer. These are all projects that will be featured on here soon, so keep checking back!</p>
