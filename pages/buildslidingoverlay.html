                        <p>In this project we will be focusing on building the smart phone home screen by using a few JavaScript functions that are very widely used in DOM manipulation.</p>

                        <p>The first will be creating an Array of objects, the next will be creating an element and lastly we will go over appending that element to the DOM.</p>

                        <p>If this is your first time looking at this it can be a little confusing, but with time it will become much easier. Knowing what you can do with JavaScript is half the battle, im</p>

                    </div>
                    <div class="project-javascript" id="project-javascript">

                        <div class="ide-mockup">
                            <img src="/img/homescreen/home-screen-javascript-001.png">
                        </div>
                        <p>The first thing we would like to do in the JavaScript is declare a variable for the "Home" button. I called it <span class="ide-purple">smartPhoneHomeButton</span> and it is grabbed by using <span class="ide-purple">[document.getElementById('smart-phone-home-button')]</span></p>

                        <p>After declaring the variable, let's put a 'click' eventListener on the <span class="ide-purple">smartPhoneHomeButton</span> variable and that leads into an anonymous function. Within the anonymous function, let's call a function called <span class="ide-purple">populateHomeScreen( );</span>. This function has not been created yet, but it will contain the code to add our list items to the DOM.</p> 
                             
                        <div class="ide-mockup">
                            <img src="/img/homescreen/home-screen-javascript-002.png">
                        </div>

                        <p>Now scroll above the eventListener and let's build an Array that is going to contain the information we will need for our App Icons. As you can see above, we only have 1 object currently in the array but as we get further along into the project, we can add more here as we need them. We will be grabbing all of this information with the use of template literals in our next step. The title is what will populate the paragraph field for the app Icon, the icon is the font awesome classes that are needed to create the icon, and the class is the class we will want to add to the list items we are creating. These will be used later to open up each separate application.</p>
                             
                        <div class="ide-mockup">
                            <img src="/img/homescreen/home-screen-javascript-003.png">
                        </div>
                        <p>Now we are going to build our populateHomeScreen( ) function. I will go through it line by line.</p>

                        <p>First you want to define your function. Call it populateHomeScreen( ) since that is what we called in the eventListener.</p>

                        <p>Now let's assign our unordered list to a variable called <span class="ide-purple">appList</span> by using the id of <span class="ide-purple">[home-screen-app-list]</span></p>

                        <p>Remove the class of <span class="ide-purple">[faded-out]</span> from appList. In case you forgot, in the HTML we applied this by default to the unordered list and in the CSS we set the class settings. This will cause us to remove the class which will then cause the element to fade in in 2000ms (This was my default, you may have changed it)</p>

                        <p>Now let's set the innerHTML of appList to a blank string. This makes it so that if you click the button more than once, it clears out the unordered list before it is repopulated. This just prevents multiple of the same elements from being added with multiple clicks.</p>

                        <p>Now let's use a forEach on the array that we created. What a forEach will do is apply a function to each and every object within the array. I have defined each item here as <span class="ide-purple">[appItem]</span>. What this means is that as it goes through the array it will assign each <span class="ide-purple">appItem</span> a number and that number will apply to that object. What we are going to do in this project, is grab the different elements of each array object and use them to fill out our list items. For example, on the first pass through the forEach function, we will be given the title, icon, and class of the time object (which is first and only object). If we had another object in the array, on the next pass through the function, it would give us that information.</p>

                        <p>The first thing we will do in the function is create a <span class="ide-purple">[button]</span> element. What this variable will do is tell the DOM/document to create a button element and assign it to the variable of <span class="ide-purple">[appBtn]</span></p>

                        <p>Next we will create another element but this time it will be an <span class="ide-purple">[li]</span> element. This list item is what will be appended (added) to the parent element, which in this case is the unordered list that is linked to the variable <span class="ide-purple">appList</span></p>

                        <p>Now we will set the class attribute on the <span class="ide-purple">[appBtn]</span> variable. The first item in the brackets is what attribute we would like to set and the second is what we would like to set it to. By using backticks, a dollar sign and a set of curly braces, we are using what is called a template literal. This allows us to access the array/object that we are currently going through and pull out certain items. Let's say this is pass through number 1, this would give us access to the items in the first object. Which means <span class="ide-purple">${appItem.class}</span> will give us a class of <span class="ide-purple">'digital-clock-app'</span></p>

                        <p>Next we would like to change what is contained within the innerHTML of the <span class="ide-purple">appBtn</span></p>

                        <p>The first line will change what Font Awesome icon we will use, and also apply the class that is stored in the array to the icon. This will be used when we open up the application by using querySelecter in an upcoming tutorial.</p>

                        <p>The second line will add the class stored in the area to the paragraph element and apply the title stored in the array to the paragraph content.</p>

                        <p>Now are are going to append the <span class="ide-purple">[appBtn]</span> to <span class="ide-purple">[li]</span>. This will make <span class="ide-purple">[li]</span> the parent element and <span class="ide-purple">[appBtn]</span> the child Element.</p>

                        <p>Now we are going to do something similar with the <span class="ide-purple">[li]</span> element, but this time it is going to be the child and <span class="ide-purple">[appList]</span> is going to be the parent.</p>

                        <p>The appendChild method is one of the most widely used methods in DOM manipulation and if you can get a decent handle on using it, it will make your Vanilla JavaScript experience much better.</p>

                        <p>So that is it! You should be able to click the home button on the smartphone and have the Time icon appear on the screen. Now that we have this set up, we can start adding other components and functions to the project.</p>
